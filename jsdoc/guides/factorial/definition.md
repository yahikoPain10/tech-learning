# Factorial Function

The factorial function is a mathematical operation denoted by the symbol `!`. It is defined for non-negative integers and represents the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the given integer. The factorial of 0 is defined as 1 by convention.

The factorial function is represented as:
n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1

For example:
- 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
- 0! = 1
